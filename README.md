# wasi
An accessible website for recently arrived immigrants to get connected to services &amp; benefits in NYC

To develop locally:
- Install Yarn (https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- From inside the project directory, run `yarn install`
- Once the dependencies are installed, run `yarn start`
- Finally, point your browser to `localhost:9000`

The site will automatically refresh on all code changes. If you want to commit any changes, first run `yarn build` to make sure these changes will be reflected in the statically served build files.

Please feel free to fork, submit pull requests, and report issues. Any help with keeping the list of resources up-to-date is especially appreciated!
